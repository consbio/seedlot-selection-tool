The seedlot selection tool (SST) is a GIS mapping program designed to help forest managers match seedlots with planting
sites based on climatic information. The tool can be used to map current climates, or future climates based on selected
climate change scenarios. Although it is tailored for matching seedlots and planting sites, it can be used by anyone
interested in mapping present or future climates defined by temperature and precipitation.
