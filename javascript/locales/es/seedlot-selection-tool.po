"The Seedlot Selection Tool is a collaboration between the US Forest "
"Service, Oregon State University, \n"

"Howe at Oregon State University College of Forestry and Brad St.Clair at "
"the USFS Pacific Northwest \n"
"Research Station, with considerable input from Ron Beloin while he was "
"working at Oregon State \n"
"University. The Conservation Biology Institute was brought onboard to bring "
"the project to fruition \n"
"through their expertise in web site design and programming for spatial "
