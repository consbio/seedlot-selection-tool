"The Seedlot Selection Tool (SST) is a web-based mapping application designed "
"to help natural resource managers match seedlots with planting sites based "
"on climatic information. Because of natural selection to different climatic "
"conditions at a location, plant populations are genetically differentiated "
"from one another and are generally locally adapted. As a result, differences "
"in climates among seedlots reflect differences in adaption. The SST maps "
"locations where a seedlot matches a planting site assuming the seedlot was "
"locally adapted to the past climate. The climates of the planting sites can "
"be chosen to represent past climates, or future climates based on selected "
"climate change scenarios. The SST allows the user to control many input "
"parameters, allowing them to explore different assumptions about climate "
"change, how plant populations are adapted to climate, and the risk tolerance "
"of the user. The eight steps described below will provide guidelines to "
"tailor the tool to your specific reforestation or restoration needs."
