=== Step 3. Select Region

North America is divided into regions to reduce processing time. You can let the tool automatically choose the region
which best fits the location you selected, or you can use the custom option to manually select any available region.

==== Automatic

Click on the `Automatic` button to let the tool select the best region for your location. The region which contains
your location and with a center point closest to your location will be selected. Before selecting a location, you can
click on the map to see which region will be selected.

==== Custom

Click on the `Custom` button to select an alternative region from a drop-down list of available regions. When you
choose a region from the drop-down menu, it will be outlined on the map. You can choose a region that does not contain
your location, in which case the tool will map the results for the region you select.
