=== Step 7. Apply Constraints

The mapped output of the SST may be further constrained using geographic limits or a species range. Using constraints
will exclude that part of the climatic output that is beyond the geographic limits imposed or beyond the current
species range. The geographic constraints include latitude, longitude, elevation, distance, and photoperiod. The
species range constraints are based on recent climate-niche models. There is also an option to import your own
shapefile to use as a constraint.
