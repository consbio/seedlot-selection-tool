=== Step 6. Select Climate Variables

Select one or more climate variables to be mapped. The climate information is derived from a climate downscaling
application called ClimateNA (see tab for more information). You also have the option to `Choose automatically`, in
which case, the climate variables chosen will be mean temperature of the coldest month (MCMT) and summer heat:moisture
index (SHM). These climate variables are chosen based on the assumption that temperate forest trees (or other plants)
are primarily adapted to cold temperatures in the winter and aridity in the summer. This option specifies a transfer
limit for MCMT of `+/- 2.0Â°C` and for SHM of `+/-` half the value at the location specified in Step 2. These transfer
limits may be modified. After choosing climate variables, the resulting table includes:

* *Name* -- the abbreviated name of the ClimateNA variable
* *Center* -- the climatic value at the center of the mapped output
* *Transfer limit* -- the transfer limit used in showing the extent of the mapped output

We caution users from selecting too many climate variables, particularly variables that are unrelated to adaptation.
The use of many climate variables will probably result in overly conservative climate matches; the more climate
variables that are included, the smaller the mapped areas will be. It is also best to avoid variables that are highly
correlated with one another.
