=== Layers

The *Layers* tab allows the user to map different overlays onto the results. Options include gray-scaled values for
different climate variables, seed and breeding zone boundaries, U.S. Level III Ecoregion boundaries, and U.S. county
boundaries. _(Under construction: some species ranges will be added as an option for layers.)_

=== Saved Runs

The *Saved Runs* tab will list each of your saved runs. Click on the name of the saved run to `Load` or `Delete` the
inputs. Once a saved run is loaded, you can recreate the map by clicking on the `Run Tool` button in the Tool tab.

=== Account

Use the *Account* menu in the upper right corner of the web site to create or sign into an account. Use an email
address and password to create an account. We will use this email address only if you lose your password. If you want
to receive updates on the SST, sign up for our newsletter by clicking the `News & Updates` button in the menu.

=== Video Tutorial

The following video tutorial demonstrates how to use the Seedlot Selection Tool. The tutorial was developed for silviculturists working in the Pacific Northwest region. It's also applicable to any region in the US where trees are being planted to be resilient to future climate.
